# Python Basic Programming Tasks

This repository contains two fundamental Python programming exercises that demonstrate basic concepts like conditionals and loops.

## 📋 Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Even or Odd Number Checker
A simple program that determines whether a given number is even or odd using conditional statements.

### Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50
A program that calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Python syntax

### Running the Programs

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Run the programs:
```bash
# For Task 1
python even_odd_checker.py

# For Task 2
python sum_1_to_50.py
```

## 📖 Task Details

### Task 1: Even or Odd Number Checker

**Problem Statement:**
- Takes an integer input from the user
- Checks whether the number is even or odd using if-else statement
- Displays the result accordingly

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.

Enter a number: 12
12 is an even number.
```

**Key Concepts:**
- User input handling
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- Modulo operator (%)
- String formatting

### Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

**Problem Statement:**
- Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50
- Calculates the sum of all integers in this range
- Displays the final sum

**Sample Output:**
```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```

**Key Concepts:**
- For loops
- Range function
- Variable accumulation
- Mathematical computation

## 🧮 Mathematical Note

The sum of first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: **n(n+1)/2**

For n = 50: 50 × 51 ÷ 2 = 1275

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing these tasks, you will understand:
- Basic input/output operations in Python
- Conditional logic implementation
- Loop structures and iteration
- Variable manipulation and arithmetic operations
- Code organization and documentation
